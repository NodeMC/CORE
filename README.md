# NodeMC Core

## Update as of October 18, 2016

I'm really sorry guys. But I have to do this. NodeMC isn't really being
maintained any more.

The reasons are twofold. For one, I've lost much of my interest in persuing
v6. It was fun, but I struggled to learn ES6, which Jared rewrote all of NodeMC
in for v6. Absolutely nothing against him, he's a great guy doing good work but 
unfortunately that rewrite sort of killed my interest. 

Also, Jared, Matthew and I have all been busy with either school or other projects.
Unfortunately, this means that we haven't had time to devote to NodeMC. I suppose
that's just how it goes for projects like this sometimes.

So - if you want to take over NodeMC, please do. It was a great project that I loved
seeing progress. It's unfortunate that we've not been able to maintain it or get
v6 out the door. 

All you have to do is either [tweet me](https://twitter.com/gmem_) or open a new pull request
with whatever you wanted to add. I'll still answer issues and moderate pull request, but I
personally will not be contributing much if any code.

**If you're looking for v5 (stable), it's at the [v5-dep](https://github.com/NodeMC/CORE/tree/v5-dep/)
branch**. This is so I can still keep that code but also make sure you can see this message.

Really sorry once again, but I hope you guys understand.

Cheers,

	Gabriel Simmer
