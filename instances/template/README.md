NodeMC-Wrapper
=====

This is the game server wrapper component of NodeMC.  
This can be launched automatically for you by NodeMC-Core, however you can also launch this manually.  

Warning
-----

Don't modify the template directory yourself. This will affect *every single new game server instance* created afterwards.

Setting up
-----

Edit the wrapperconfig.json file, then either run the wrapper or run NodeMC-Core to manage it for you.
